[This white paper](http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/people/tom.hamill/WhitePaperImplementationofReforecastsandNationalBlend.pdf) from [NOAA](noaa.gov) gives a couple of suggestions to produce statistically post-processed operational weather forecasts. In particular


> (e) developing the capacity and then regularly producing global reanalyses
> and reforecasts, and making this data easily available in a timely fashion
> for post­processing system development inside and external to NOAA; 

For researchers and users of the raw forecast data, this point is most important. 
NOAA is doing a very good job publishing their raw data, better than European weather services.

> The basic concept behind post­processing is simple; use a training data set
> of past forecasts and observations, ideally from a fixed
> assimilation/forecast system, to determine the adjustments to the current
> forecast.
